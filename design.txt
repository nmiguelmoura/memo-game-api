What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

I opted for redesigning all game, to adapt it to a memo game,
which is completely different from the example provided.
So, I added several new properties to my model, to allow to store moves,
store cards found and ranking players.


What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing
the new game logic?

The hardest part to implement was oauth. The process is way more simple
with endpoints, but now I am able to apply it to all my projects.
All the rest went fine. Typically, in a memo game, all logic is handled in
javascript. This approach is allowed me to simplify javascript, because most
logic was handled in server-side. Even so, because of endpoints nature,
the game is slow to respond to user interaction and I
wouldn't use it for a memo game in production.
